Economy / Traiding mod.

Basics
============

What does AuctionHouse do ?

AuctionHouse is a auctioning plugin that comes whith its own econom system (im thinking on adding nesesary apis for moders or aditional economy system support).

The as the user uses the correct command do set up an auction the item that is auctioned will be removed.

Then the auction is publicly seen and all the players can partisipate in the auctioning if they want to.

The AhBank [AuctionHouse economy system] is a system that lets users trade items in to currensy [you use the items (like gold) as a currensy].
The player can easily withdraw/deposit his funds. Or send them to other players.
